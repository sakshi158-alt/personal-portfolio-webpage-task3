#OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
This is a simple portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. The website includes multiple sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact, providing an overview of your work as a web developer. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.The HTML structure consists of several sections that represent different parts of your portfolio.!DOCTYPE html>: Declares that this document is an HTML5 document.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies that the character encoding used is UTF-8 (supports many languages).
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page is responsive and scales well on different devices.
<title>My Portfolio</title>: Sets the title of the page that appears in the browser tab.The <nav> element wraps the navigation links that allow users to jump to different sections of the page.
<ul> is an unordered list that contains <li> (list items) with <a> (anchor) elements, which are clickable links to different sections.
href="#home": Links to the "Home" section.
href="#about": Links to the "About" section.
href="#projects": Links to the "Projects" section.
href="#contact": Links to the "Contact" section.
The <footer> contains the footer text of the page.
&copy; is an HTML entity for the copyright symbol. The [Your Name] should be replaced with your name or branding.
The CSS is used to style the webpage and make it visually appealing.The header has a dark background (#333), white text (#fff), and padding for spacing. The text is centered.
The navigation is styled as a horizontal list that becomes a vertical list on smaller screens (via the media query).The footer has a similar dark background, white text, and centered alignment.
The position: fixed and bottom: 0 keep the footer at the bottom of the page, even when the user scrolls.This media query ensures that on screens smaller than 768px, the navigation links stack vertically (flex-direction: column) instead of horizontally.
It also adjusts the margin of the list items to make them more spaced out on smaller screens.This is a simple, clean portfolio template. It's a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing. You can further enhance it by adding images, animations, and other interactive features (e.g., a contact form).
